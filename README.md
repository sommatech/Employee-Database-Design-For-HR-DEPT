**# Employee-Database-Design-For-HR-DEPT**
Here is the data that the HR department depends on to have full visibility of the company’s employees and their data. Now instead of maintaining this data on disparate spreadsheets, the company wants to have a single Database where all this tables will be housed to avoid the risk of losing them and to improve reporting efficiency.

The primary objective of the database design is to create a structured and relational data model that efficiently manages employee information, department structures, project management assignments, and geographical data. This database is designed to support various business operations, including employee management, departmental analysis, and project oversight, while enabling robust data retrieval and reporting functionalities. The design ensures data integrity, reduces redundancy, and allows for seamless data aggregation and analysis, which are essential for informed decision-making within the organization.

**Summary of Reporting Queries;**
The project includes a series of SQL queries and stored procedures that cater to specific data analysis and reporting needs of HR Dept:


**Employee Salary Analysis:**
Identifies employees with identical salaries, providing insights into potential salary standardization or anomalies. Retrieves the second-highest salary to assist in compensation benchmarking.


**Departmental Salary Insights:**
Fetches the maximum salary within each department, allowing the organization to understand compensation distribution across departments.


**Project Manager Workforce Distribution:**
Provides a count of employees managed by each project manager, sorted by the number of employees, aiding in resource allocation and managerial performance assessment.


**Employee Data Formatting:**
Extracts and formats employee names and salaries for simplified reporting, useful in payroll management and internal communications.


**Row-Based Data Retrieval:**
Selects only odd-numbered rows, demonstrating data filtering capabilities which could be useful for sampling or segmented reporting.


**High-Salary Employee Reporting:**
Develops a stored procedure to fetch details of high-earning employees, which is critical for talent management and retention strategies.


**Targeted Data Functionality:**
A scalar function identifies the highest-paid employee within a specific department, enabling targeted salary analysis and departmental budget planning.


**Salary Adjustment Automation:**
A stored procedure is designed to automate salary adjustments for IT employees under specific project managers, streamlining HR processes and ensuring consistent salary updates.


**Comprehensive Employee Reporting:**
A complex stored procedure fetches and organizes employee data, including their department, project manager, and state, providing a holistic view of the workforce. The inclusion of error handling ensures robustness in data retrieval.


**Impact on Business Processes;**
The database design and its associated queries have a significant impact on various business processes:
Data-Driven Decision Making: By providing detailed insights into employee compensation, departmental structures, and project management, the organization can make informed decisions regarding promotions, salary adjustments, and resource allocation.
Operational Efficiency: Automated procedures for salary updates and comprehensive data retrieval streamline HR operations, reduce manual effort, and minimize the risk of errors in critical processes such as payroll management and employee reporting.
Resource Management: The ability to analyze workforce distribution across project managers and departments enables more effective resource management, ensuring that managers are neither overburdened nor underutilized.
Strategic Planning: The reporting capabilities allow for strategic planning regarding compensation policies, workforce expansion, and department-level budgeting, contributing to overall organizational growth and sustainability.
Error Mitigation: The inclusion of error handling within stored procedures ensures that business processes are resilient to data anomalies or system failures, maintaining continuity in reporting and decision-making.

**The tools use for this project** are 
SQLSever, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
